COMMENT!
Note. 
Here we need to rearrange the formula. This is because integer division 
in the current form would lead to wrong results. 
Rearranging the formula becomes:
(50xd + 50yc)/cd.
!
;try to apply integer division in x/c and y/d, the result will be zero as 0<quotent<1. however, using the above formula 
;this problem is eliminated as the quotent is percentage not 0<quotent<1

.data ; data segment
	; define your variables here
	cwMark DWORD 35 ; this is x
	cwTotal DWORD 60 ; this is c
	testMark DWORD 45 ; this is y
	testTotal DWORD 55 ; this is d
	pcw DWORD 50 ; this is coursework percentage contribution
	pt DWORD 50	; this is test pecentage contribution
	sumCw DWORD 0 ; variable to hold 50xd
	sumTest DWORD 0 ; varible to hold 50yc
	divisor DWORD 0 ; variable to hold cd
	quotient DWORD 0 ; division result
